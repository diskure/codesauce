 <h1>SKARLET</h1>
 <h2>By Aaron Dela Cruz, 2022</h2>
 <p>I really enjoy art, especially pixel art. This project was inspired by a thing in reddit called r/place. It is where reddit users can come together to make pixel art on a online canvas. Each user can only plac edown one pixel a few minutes and becasue of this, multiple communities came together to make amazing art. At the end of r/place, there is always a timelapse feature. I love watching the process of art being made becasue it feels like i'm invlovled in a way. So this project is using an image I made in a pixel art creator and I want to make the image have different types of effects through code. my fovrite work form this project is SKARLET 3 where the pixels move up and down, making the image look disfigured. Overall, this project was really fun to make.<br>
